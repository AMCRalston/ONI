A Stale Network Address Configuration "SNAC" attack is conducted as follows.

1. Get eavesarp
 https://github.com/arch4ngel/eavesarp

2. Listen for arps on the network 
	- sudo ./eavesarp.py capture -i eth0

3. Once we have identified possible SNAC vulnerable hosts lets collect more 
information by leveraging the -ar and -dr (ARP and DNS Resolution) flags
       ctrl+c --> sudo ./eavesarp.py capture -i eth0 -ar -dr  

4. Add the Stale target IP to our interface
       - ip addr add <TargetIP>/24 dev eth0

5. Conduct a packet capture of the interface...

6. Use responder to capture creds... 

7. MITM - if there is a PTR-FWD we can enable IP forwarding and MASQUERADE be a MITM between the two. 
     -Run the eavesarp-MITM.sh with ips 

8. if there is any authentication or things happening we can relay, capture etc..
